# text-adventure-game

The two most important files are the gametext file and Game.java 

The last block of code in the Game file (lines 403-406) is what runs in the terminal

This was written in spring 2017, and I truly have no idea if I wrote the text file or if it was given to us as part of the assignment, so no judging the story lol
